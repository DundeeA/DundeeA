# Hello!
 
My name is dundee, I'm a self-taught web developer currently practicing front-end development but interested in learning full-stack. I got my first taste of programming when I was really young developing video games to play with my siblings, after that I was hooked, I can't think of anything better than bringing ideas to life through code. I'm always excited to learn more by solving the next big problem that comes my way. 

## Things I code with
 
**Javascript**
**Jquery**
**CSS**
